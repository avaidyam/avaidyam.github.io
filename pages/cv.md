# Projects 

- MyDoctor — February 2017 to August 2017
	- URL: https://github.com/pieee-embs/MyDoctor
	- A conversational agent (“chatbot”) that helps make the process of visiting the doctor easier developed at HackIllinois 2017. Patients report symptoms in standard language which are then interpreted and matched as ICD-10 and SNOMED-CT codes, sent to their care provider. MyDoctor bridges the gap between patient and physician effectively as a local triage tool without faulty diagnosis, instead deferring the patient’s treatment plan to the physician. 
- Purdue IEEE Directory Services — January 2017 to May 2017 
	- IEEE's DirectoryServices are a multipart API layer: an LDAP and Mailman REST API layer to support mailing list and profile read actions (currently only with Purdue's directory); a Directory API that manages members, their subscriptions and profiles; and an authentication layer that supports REST token-based stateless auth. DirectoryServices provides an auth-less user layer for other tools used internally. 
- BoilerBooks (v2.0) — January 2017 to July 2017 
	- URL: https://github.com/PurdueIEEE/boilerbooks/tree/v2 
	- Co-developed and rewrote a financial tracking (expense reporting, reimbursement tracking, income & purchase approval facilitation, dues tracking, apparel sales) system for internal use by Purdue IEEE, including a REST API layer and ReactJS client SPA. 
- Groupr — January 2017 to March 2017 
	- URL: https://github.com/Groupr-Purdue
	- At Purdue, computer science students enroll in many courses that require teamwork to build software. The current method of forming groups involves the use of Piazza, a Q&A web service that is not primarily built for team building. Students can only view existing teams, as well as other students looking for teams, by relying on those people to post a comment. Groupr aims to solve this problem by allowing students to easily organize and communicate on one platform, built specifically for forming teams for classes at Purdue. Students will be able to see exactly which teams are looking for members, as well as everyone who is still looking. 
- Xinu in Rust — June 2015 to August 2017 
	- URL: https://github.com/real-xinu
	- A complete rewrite of the XINU kernel (developed by Prof. Doug Comer) in the experimental low-level systems language Rust (developed by the Mozilla Foundation). 
- Health365 — June 2015 to August 2017 
	- URL: https://github.com/ScienceSquad/Health
	- Health365 is a mobile smartphone and wearable app, seamlessly integrating health and wellness into its users’ lives. There currently exist several mobile applications that can be used to track calories, record physical activity, measure sleep patterns, etc., but few applications have managed to incorporate these into a single cohesive and user-friendly experience with insight and fitness suggestions. 
- Parrot — August 2012 to August 2017 
	- URL: https://github.com/avaidyam/Parrot 
	- Parrot is a cross platform communication platform designed with a hardware-accelerated layered compositing framework UI, and scalable XMPP and REST backend supporting Windows, OS X, iOS, and Android. 
- Binoculars — August 2011 to June 2013, August 2014 to May 2017 
	- URL: https://github.com/avaidyam/Binoculars 
	- Binoculars is backed by an extensible multi-core parallel processing architecture that allows for dynamic runtime extensions, and communication over multiple nodes in a distributed cluster or grid. Anything from simple classroom discussion boards to distributed Maya model rendering is possible. Heterogenous computing is made simple and user-friendly.
