The Touch Bar on macOS however lacks discoverability: just like the trackpad, it needs force touch to mimic physical keys. When you "touch" or "scan" your fingers across, you should feel the haptics of keys, dials, or sliders - but only when you deep press, should you "activate" the button or control, mimicking a physical keyboard press. Also, why doesn\'t every single Mac come with it?
