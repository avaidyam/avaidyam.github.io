His research focus ranges from engineering and architecting healthcare systems that improve access and quality of care to investigating the underlying symptomatology of mental illness. As a principal architect of the LAMP Platform, Vaidyam focuses on elucidating the key design goals of a healthcare platform that supports personalized just-in-time adaptive interventions and digital phenotyping in populations with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. In clinical research, Vaidyam focuses on the use of machine learning algorithms for longitudinal data analysis and personalized interventions for mindfulness and patient education. Vaidyam also investigates the digital therapeutic alliance as manifested in non-conventional digital formats, such as voice assistants, as well as the needs, requirements, and barriers to adoption in patients with serious mental illness. Vaidyam assisted in developing a program for digital skills training to help patients with limited technical experience access and rely on digital tools and apps assisting them in managing their physical or mental health.

The current method of forming groups involves the use of Piazza, a Q&amp;A web service that is not primarily built for team building. Students can only view existing teams, as well as other students looking for teams, by relying on those people to post a comment. Groupr aims to solve this problem by allowing students to easily organize and communicate on one platform, built specifically for forming teams for classes at Purdue. Students will be able to see exactly which teams are looking for members, as well as everyone who is still looking. </li></ul></li><li><a href="https://github.com/real-xinu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinu in Rust</a> — June 2015 to August 2017 <ul><li>A complete rewrite of the XINU kernel (developed by Prof. Doug Comer) in the experimental low-level systems language Rust (developed by the Mozilla Foundation). </li></ul></li><li><a href="https://github.com/ScienceSquad/Health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Health365</a> — June 2015 to August 2017 <ul><li>Health365 is a mobile smartphone and wearable app, seamlessly integrating health and wellness into its users’ lives.
